# Cricket Leinster Database Project
## Project Explanation 

I was required to complete and submit a project, which required me to design and implement my own database based on the following requirements:

A minimum of 6 relational tables
Appropriate implicit constraints (including primary & foreign keys)
Explicit (semantic) constraints such as table constraint(s) and triggers (you need not implement assertions)
At least one view should also be defined within the database
A minimum of 5 tuples per table
